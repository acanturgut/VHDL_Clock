## Clock Implementation with VHDL

> KoÃ§ University - ELEC 204 -Digital Design Course Final Project - Spring 2015

> In this project Spartan 3E XC3S100E CP132 Packages were used.

> CLK signal from board was also modified according to our wants and
> improves counting quality of all modes.

**OBJECTIVE**: Purpose of the project is fully understanding and starting empty project, for that purpose LED digital clock was designed, implemented and demonstrated on VHDL board. LED digital clock includes several modes such as alarm, set, chronometer, and M/S/H, D/Month/Y normal clock mode.

**PROGRESSION**: Before the start project, simple schematic was designed.

Switch 0 and 1 directly related with the changing modes. Mode change set on 2 bit. Switch 1 switches hour to year mode. Hour to year switch set on 1bit. And only related with normal mode

    SWITCH0-SWITCH1: 00 => NORMAL MODE 
    SWITCH0-SWITCH1: 10 => ALARM MODE 
    SWITCH0-SWITCH1: 01 => SET MODE 
    SWITCH0-SWITCH1: 11 => CHRONOMETER MODE

After this relation, button relations were designed in order to mod selection.
All buttons defined in 1 bit. Buttons change several states when they pressed once.

Button relation were given below.

 1. **NORMAL MODE**

Four Seven Segment Display: Shows only integers and H and Y letters.
Button0: Show current year or hour

 2. **ALARM MODE**

Four Seven Segment Display: Shows only integers.
LEDS: On-Off

    Button0: Change selection minute or hour 
    Button1: Save changes 
    Button2: Increment selected item 
    Button3: Decrement selected item

 4. **CHRONOMETER MODE**

Four Seven Segment Display: Shows only integers.

    Button0: Start counting 
    Button1: Reset counting 
    Button2: Pause counting

 5. **SET MODE**

Four Seven Segment Display: Shows only integers H, Y and two N N for displaying M.

    Button0: Change selection minute to year 
    Button1: Save changes 
    Button2: Increment selected item 
    Button3: Decrement selected item

All Led set into 1 into one signal. All Led works together only in alarm mode. Led set into 8 bit.

4 Seven segment displays shows different values according to selected mode. 4 Displays display 4 different value at the same time with clock of the board.
